## Business Understanding
- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e., he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## Conclusions
- Taking out larger loans, especially in the range of $15,000 to $35,000, makes it more likely that the borrower won't be able to repay.
- Borrowing more money increases the risk of not being able to pay it back.
- Loans for small businesses and renewable energy have a higher chance of not being repaid, maybe because these ventures come with more risks.
- People with yearly incomes between $4,000 and $45,000 are more likely to struggle with repayments, showing a link between lower income and repayment difficulties.
- If you don't own property, like a house, you're more likely to have trouble repaying a loan.
